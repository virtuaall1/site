validate-skill-bundle.py — the pre-delivery gate, as assertions.

Checks a staged skill directory (and optionally its packed .skill bundle)
against the criteria the INSTALLER enforces, not against what seems
sensible. Every check compares a measurement to a bound in the same step:
an unasserted metric manufactures confidence that no defect exists.

Usage
-----
  python3 validate-skill-bundle.py <staged-skill-dir> [--bundle file.skill] [--pack out.skill]
  python3 validate-skill-bundle.py --repo-only <repo-dir>

  --pack        writes a well-formed bundle (POSIX separators on any platform)
                after the directory checks pass, then validates it.
  --repo        additionally check the repo's manifests against the skill.
  --repo-only   check ONLY the repo's manifests, skipping the skill checks.

Why --repo-only exists: in a repo whose root IS the skill directory
(`SKILL.md` at the top level), the two check sets contradict each other.
The skill checks require the directory name to equal the frontmatter `name`
and forbid a plugin manifest; the repo is named after the repository, not
the skill, and is the one place the manifest belongs. Running the skill
checks over a repo root therefore reports two failures that are both
correct behaviour. Point the skill checks at the staged skill directory and
`--repo-only` at the repo.

Exit status 0 = every check passed; 1 = at least one failed (all failures
are listed, not just the first).

Limits are stated as numbers and labelled with where they come from, so
the check is implementable without guessing and can be updated when the
consumer changes them.

# TARGET is reported on every run, passing or failing, so the debt stays

# the skill under test — `core_max_lines:` in SKILL.md frontmatter, or a
# `.core-ceiling` file beside it holding the number. A skill that declares
# neither has not opted in: the count is reported and nothing is gated. This
